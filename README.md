# Formula Hybrid Suspension Simulation (FHSS)
V1.5 . Suspension simulator for the FSAE car; geometrically models suspension, computes forces on bellcrank components and chassis dynamics. 
To use the script, run SuspensionBellcrankSimulatorMAIN to calculate and completely model the suspension. Afterwards, the data outputted to the .txt files can be viewed using SuspensionBellcrankSimulatorREADER. 
As for the structure of classes in the scripts, the function names correspond to a component of the assembly and what it calculates for that component. If that information is not clear, the Vars() class at the end of CLASSES and CLASSES2 might provide some clarity. Otherwise, I will add comments to the classes and variables as time goes on.
