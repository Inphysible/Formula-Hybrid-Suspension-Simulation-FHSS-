# Formula Hybrid Suspension Simulation (FHSS)

I wrote a space and force vector solver in python that calculates the static and dynamic forces of suspension components in a double wishbone configuration. Uses spatial information defined by an absolute coordinate system and uses a basis relative to that for each component for motion and force vectors. The motion is constrained by rigidity of components, and is solved using `scipy`'s root finder optimization. The spatial information is also used to geometrically model the suspension system for graphing purposes. Shock absorber dynamics were approximated by treating the system as a spring-mass-damper and packaging the resulting system of ODEs into State-space form for use in a signal processing algorithm, `scipy.signal.lsim`. This generates useful solution spaces for a given domain, of which contains road surface curve, car speed, and shock absorber spring constant and damping constant.

In order to use these scrips, enter spatial information into `SuspensionGeometry.txt` by following the directions in that file, then run SuspensionBellcrankSimulatorMAIN to completely model the suspension. The data outputted by the scripts can be found in the outputs folder, and can be visualized using `SuspensionBellcrankSimulatorREADER`. Descriptions for each of the class varaibles can be found in `SuspensionBellcrankSimulatorCLASSES.Vars()`, although they are quite superficial; writing tailored descriptions for the functions and variables in the scripts is an ongoing task. A blanket description of the function calls and outputs can be found in this non-peer reviewed paper I wrote: https://github.com/Inphysible/Formula-Hybrid-Suspension-Simulation-FHSS-/blob/1.0/MAIN%20REPORT.pdf
